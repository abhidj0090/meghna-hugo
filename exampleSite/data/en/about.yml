    title: We're Comparatists
    content: we are an independent academic forum for young comparatists. It carries
      the legacy of the Modern Indian Languages department which was initiated in
      1919. Our forum provides a space for literary comparison between Indian languages
      and literatures. In a process of encouraging  scholars and students of Literature
      and Social Science to share their research interests and ideas in our platform
      we help them to comment, connect and communicate with each other.
